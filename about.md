## What?

**Read The LOD** is a grassroots LOD initiative that organizes reading-and-discussion clubs around relevant contemporary Linked Data and Semantic Web documents.

## Why?

- to read everything you always wanted but never took up time for,
- to be able to ask those questions that have been bothering you,
- to share ideas, strategies, motivational spins, use cases and components,
- and to keep building the community.
