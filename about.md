Read the LOD is a grassroots LOD initiative that organizes reading-and-discussion clubs around relevant contemporary Linked Data and Semantic Web documents.

#### Why?

- to read everything you always wanted but never took up time for,
- to be able to ask those questions that have been bothering you,
- to share ideas, strategies, motivational spins, use cases and components,
- and to keep building the community.

#### Where, when and what?

The location and date of reading clubs, together with their specific topic, gets determined through polls on the [ReadtheLOD chat channel](https://chat.semantic.works/#/room/#readthelod:chat.semantic.works).  
Other updates (such as reports, etc.) will be communicated to our members.  
Be sure to register as a [member](https://readthelod.org/members), and keep an eye out for updates on our chat channel!

More information is available [here](https://readthelod.org/readingclubs).
