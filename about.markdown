### A reading club for relevant contemporary Linked Data and Semantic Web documents

-Foreseen timeline- 
- May 2022: brainstorm session to coalition of hosts, list of accepted papers --> register via [this link]()! - need to present more info on what the brainstorm would entail + work with moodle platform
- Beginning of June 2022: launch of first reading clubs registrations
- Enf of June 2022: kick-off first reading club

-priliminary ideas- 
- Delineate interesting LOD topics - listing the involved relevant papers, specification and standards --> check-out the [preliminary reading list]({{site.baseurl}}{% link the-reads.markdown %})
- Organize reading clubs around a specific LOD topic, with an accompanied cluster of relevant papers
- It would be cool if the central focus paper is explicated by the author(s) - but this depends on the topic.
- Indicate difficulty levels & practical knowledge tags per reading club topic / paper
- Organize developper meetings - with a low threshold
